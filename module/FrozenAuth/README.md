# FrozenAuth authentication module

This is a Authentication module for use with ZendFramework

This module is largely based on [this](https://olegkrivtsov.github.io/using-zend-framework-3-book/html/en/User_Management__Authentication_and_Access_Filtering.html) book by [Oleg Krivtsov](https://github.com/olegkrivtsov).

I have adjusted to my liking.
